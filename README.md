# EzChat
Won **second prize** in YANTRA-ILLUMINA hackathon and deeply appreciated by sponsors. (prototype attached)

# Problem Statement
Government websites can be difficult to navigate and use, especially for the majority of Indian civilians due to complexity of the website and pre-requisite of experience with websites. 
Even for an educated individual a simple task cannot be completed within 15 minutes(based on verbal SURVEY of 50 users).
Filling forms can take very long durations since even one mistake asks for resubmission of form .

# Solution
We've made a chatbot that can answer all questions about the government from When does my driver's license expire? to How do I apply for passport?
The chatbot will be available on all domains of goverment websites and once a user is logged in, would connect to the database to answer the user specific questions as well! 

We are working on integrating Google API for speech to text and text to speech for further enhancing user friendliness.
The above said feature will also help in translating the queries and responses in **120+ languages**.

With this chatbot every field can be taken line-by-line which will ensure that progress is being saved and if there is any error it is indicated immediately.
